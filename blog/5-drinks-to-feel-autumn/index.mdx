Here are some of special beverages to bring a pinch of magic into your autumn.
Do not hesitate and try them all!

- Mulled wine

---

_Mulled wine_ (or _spice wine_) is a traditional Nordic alcohol drink (called there Gl√∏gg) during Christmas time but I don't find better way to enjoy it rather than in the middle of fall.
Made from red wine, fruits and bunch of seducive spices, like cinammon, star anise, nutmeg, ginger, and carnation.
Pieces of fresh orange or dry peels usually are added as well. You can experiment with different flavours ‚Äì try addding cranberry juice, lemon or raisins to your magic cup.
Adding whole sticks and grains of spices is also much better than putting everything in powder form.
What I adore about mulled wine ‚Äì is that it both tastes good and relaxes you better than anything in the evening. And what makes it good to drink outside in winter is of course its hot temperature!
Mulled wine is cooked until it reaches ariund 80 degrees Celsius, however, boiling can extract hevy alcohols from it and is highly not recommended.

- Hot chocolate with marshmallows  
  This drinkk and dessert definetely deserves your attention during autumn time. I recommend trying it in rainy weather, adding your favorite add-ons, such as marshmallows on top.
  When I am in a coffesshop and don't want to buy a coffee, I will probably order a cup of aromatic hot chocolate.
- Pumpkin spicy latte
  Another favorite beverage for moody October days. Despite its name, it is not really spicy but rather addictive and full of generous pumpkin flavour.
  What makes it special is of course pumpkin spice, however, I recommend to experiment with 2 table spoons of pumpkin puree if you want to make it at home.
- Citrus tea
  Citrus tea is amazing way to wake up your organism, moreover it may be really helpful if you catch a cold.
  You can try both hot and iced versions of it, latter tastes just like a lemonade. You can buy some citrus-flavoured tea packs in any shop, and also make it on your own, adding some cloves, juice and sugar as well.
- Kissel
  One can call it a separate dish but I want to assure you that kissel can be a drink, if it has proper consistence. You can find some ready-made powders in a supermarket (at least in Poland),
  and prepare it only filling your cup with a boiled water. If you wish to make it on your own - very well - only 2 ingredients are required, juice and any starch for thickening.
  In such way you can regulate viscosity of final dish, more thicker variants can be served as separate deserts or with pancakes and ice cream.
